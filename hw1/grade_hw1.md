### Overall Grade: 94/100

### Quality of report: 10/10

-   Is the homework submitted (git tag time) before deadline? 

-   Is the final report in a human readable format html? 

-   Is the report prepared as a dynamic document (R markdown) for better reproducibility?

-   Is the report clear (whole sentences, typos, grammar)? Do readers have a clear idea what's going on and how are results produced by just reading the report? 

### Completeness, correctness and efficiency of solution: 44/50

- Q1 (10/10)

- Q2 (12/20)

You must use `zcat` to display the number of lines in each file. -3pts. 

For Q2.5, it's also asking to list the number of unique times each value appears. i.e how many times `MARRIED` shows up in `marital_status`. -5pts

- Q3 (12/10)

- Q4 (10/10)
	    
### Usage of Git: 10/10

-   Are branches (`master` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `master` branch?

-   Are there enough commits? Are commit messages clear? 
          
-   Is the hw1 submission tagged? 

-   Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly? 
  
-   Do not put a lot auxiliary files into version control. 

-   If those gz data files or `pride_and_prejudice.txt` are in Git, take 5 points off.

### Reproducibility: 10/10

-   Are the materials (files and instructions) submitted to the `master` branch sufficient for reproducing all the results? Just click the `knit` button will produce the final `html` on teaching server? 

-   If necessary, are there clear instructions, either in report or in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?

### R code style: 20/20

For bash commands, only enforce the 80-character rule.

-   [Rule 5.](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml#spacing) Do not place a space before a comma, but always place one after a comma.
